# Same Stats
This is my adjustment of the code provided by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice here https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs

## Their original comments on the code 
"""
Usage:
    same_stats.py run <shape_start> <shape_end> [<iters>][<decimals>][<frames>]
    This is code created for the paper:
    Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing
    Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice
    ACM CHI 2017
    The paper, video, and associated code and datasets can be found on the Autodesk Research website: http://www.autodeskresearch.com/papers/samestats
    For any questions, please contact Justin Matejka (Justin.Matejka@Autodesk.com)
    The most basic way to try this out is to run a command like this from the command line:
    python same_stats.py dino circle
    That will start with the Dinosaurus dataset, and morph it into a circle.
    I have stripped out some of the functionality for some examples in the paper, for the time being, to make
    the code easeier to follow. If you would like the dirty, perhaps unrunnable for you, code, contact me and
    I can get it to you. I will be adding all that functionality back in, in a more reasonable way shortly, and
    will have the project hosted on GitHub so it is easier to share.
